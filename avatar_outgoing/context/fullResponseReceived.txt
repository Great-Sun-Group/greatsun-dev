The provided files `init-environment.sh` and `start-services.sh` are Bash scripts used for setting up and starting various services in a development environment.

Here's an overview of what each script does:

**init-environment.sh**

1. Defines a function `check_secret` to ensure that required environment variables (secrets) are set.
2. Checks if the script is running in a Codespaces environment (based on the `CODESPACES` environment variable).
   - If running in Codespaces, it expects the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set.
   - If running locally, it expects a `.env` file to be present and sources it.
3. Calls the `check_secret` function for various required secrets, such as `CLAUDE`, `DJANGO_SECRET`, `GH_PAT`, `JWT_SECRET`, Neo4j credentials, `OPEN_EXCHANGE_RATES_API`, and `WHATSAPP_BOT_API_KEY`.
4. Defines a function `add_submodule` to add Git submodules from the `Great-Sun-Group` organization on GitHub, using the `GH_PAT` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication.
5. Adds the `credex-ecosystem/credex-core` and `credex-ecosystem/vimbiso-pay` submodules.
6. Activates a virtual environment located at `/home/vscode/venv/bin/activate`.
7. Installs dependencies for the `credex-core` and `vimbiso-pay` projects.
8. Installs dependencies for the `greatsun-dev` project.

**start-services.sh**

1. Defines a function `start_service` to start a service by executing a given command and redirecting its output to a log file.
2. Starts the `greatsun-dev` service by running `python main.py` and redirecting the output to `greatsun-dev.log`.
3. Starts the `credex-core` service by running `npm run dev` and redirecting the output to `credex-core.log`.
4. Activates the virtual environment for `vimbiso-pay`, starts the `vimbiso-pay` service by running `python app/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`, and deactivates the virtual environment.
5. Waits for a maximum of 60 seconds for all services to start successfully, checking for specific log entries in their respective log files.
   - If all services start successfully, it prints a success message.
   - If the timeout is reached and one or more services fail to start, it prints an error message along with the last 20 lines of each service's log file.
6. Tails (continuously prints new lines) the log files for all services (`credex-core.log`, `vimbiso-pay.log`, and `greatsun-dev.log`) in the `/workspaces/greatsun-dev/central-logs/` directory.

The scripts assume that the `greatsun-dev` project and its dependencies are located in the `/workspaces/greatsun-dev` directory, and the `credex-core` and `vimbiso-pay` submodules are located in `/workspaces/greatsun-dev/credex-ecosystem/`.

Please note that these scripts are specific to the development environment and project structure of the `greatsun-dev` project and its related services. They may need to be modified or adapted to work in a different environment or project structure.
