# Current Project

Set up the greatsun-dev environment for testing and deploying credex-core and credex-bot

## Overview
The greatsun-dev environment is designed to facilitate rapid testing and deployment of credex-core and credex-bot. This setup aims to streamline the development process and ensure efficient integration of these key components.

## Components

### 1. credex-core
- Description: The core API for the credex ecosystem.
- Technology: Express.js server
- Key Features:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Database integration
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Transaction processing

### 2. vimbiso-pay
- Description: A WhatsApp chatbot for user interactions
- Technology: Python

## Development Goals
1. Set up a unified development environment that supports both JavaScript (Node.js) and Python.
2. Implement a streamlined testing process for both components.
3. Develop a deployment pipeline that ensures smooth updates to both credex-core and credex-bot.
4. Create comprehensive documentation for the setup and maintenance of the greatsun-dev environment.




7. Undo Operation: Consider adding an "undo" feature for the merge operation, in case the developer wants to revert the merge.

8. Status Command: It might be helpful to have a command that shows the current status of all repositories (current branch, any uncommitted changes, etc.).
