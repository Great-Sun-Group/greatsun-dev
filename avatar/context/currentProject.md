Set up the greatsun-dev environment for testing and deploying credex-core and credex-bot as quickly as possible.

# Extended Project Details

## Overview
The greatsun-dev environment is designed to facilitate rapid testing and deployment of credex-core and credex-bot. This setup aims to streamline the development process and ensure efficient integration of these key components.

## Components

### 1. credex-core
- Description: The core API for the credex ecosystem.
- Technology: Express.js server
- Key Features:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - Database integration
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Transaction processing

### 2. credex-bot (vimbiso-pay)
- Description: A WhatsApp chatbot for user interactions
- Technology: Python

## Development Goals
1. Set up a unified development environment that supports both JavaScript (Node.js) and Python.
2. Implement a streamlined testing process for both components.
3. Develop a deployment pipeline that ensures smooth updates to both credex-core and credex-bot.
4. Create comprehensive documentation for the setup and maintenance of the greatsun-dev environment.

## Next Steps
1. Configure the development container with all necessary dependencies for both credex-core and credex-bot.
2. Set up automated testing scripts that can be run in the greatsun-dev environment.
3. Implement a local database for testing purposes. (done)
4. Create mock external services to simulate real-world interactions.
5. Develop a set of sample transactions and user interactions to test the full system flow.

## Long-term Objectives
- Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Develop a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Create a scalable architecture that can handle increasing load as the user base grows.
- Implement robust security measures to protect user data and transactions.
- Develop analytics tools to monitor system performance and user behavior.

This extended project outline provides a more comprehensive view of the greatsun-dev environment and its objectives. It serves as a roadmap for the development team and helps to align efforts towards common goals.
