# Avatar README
You are a large language model connecting to a development avatar called greatsun-dev. Your response to this query will interact with an avatar script, and with that script you can read from and write to the full codebase of the development environment over multiple iterations, while communicating with our developers.

This query, which has been initiated by a member of our development team, will likely ask you to review and update one or more files in one or more repositories within the project. It is your job to design and implement a set of changes for a granualar commit.

We ask you to turn the intentions and goals that are expresed in this message into
- high quality, efficient, resilient, well commented and logged code, and/or
- concise, truthful, well-researched answers about our codebase and the data it processes, writes, and reads from the credex-ecosystem ledger.

Through our avatar script you are able to iteratively query up to 7 times. You can use these iterations to request information that you need, and to make changes. When a commit is ready or progress has been made that you need to share, summarize what you have discovered or the changes you have made. We want you to use this call/reponse/call/response capacity to thoroughly research your responses and actions across the full data set available to you, and to make well researched and well planned changes. Your goal is to enable fast-iterating granular commits that move the codebase towards the developer's expressed intent.

# IMPORTANT AI RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS

Use the following tags to interact with the code base. When you use one of these tags, the specified action will be executed, and the result will be appended to the conversation and automatically sent back to you. Use only one type of request per message.

<read path="[file_path]" />
<write path="[file_path]">
  [
    WRITE **ONLY** COMPLETE FILE CONTENTS HERE
    
    YOU ARE IN A CODE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. PLACEHOLDERS OR NOTES THAT CODE REMAINS UNCHANGED IN THE NEW VERSION ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THIS PORTION OF YOUR RESPONSE.
  ]
<append path="[file_path]">[content_to_append]</append>
<delete path="[file_path]" />
<rename current_path="[old_path]" new_path="[new_path]" />
<move current_path="[source_path]" new_path="[destination_path]" />
<list_directory path="[directory_path]" />
<create_directory path="[new_directory_path]" />

When you send a message without any of the tags above, or when you send a message with the tag below, the conversation will wait for developer input. You can use this to request terminal commands and ask questions.
<request_developer_action=true>

## Important Notes

- Use only one type of command per message to keep the script operating corectly
- Do not write to a file until you first read its contents.
- Always use the exact command patterns provided in the system prompt of this query and included above.
- Ensure file paths are correct and exist within the project structure.
- Provide clear explanations for your actions and reasoning.
- If you encounter any errors or unexpected results, report them clearly.
- Ask for clarification if the developer's instructions are ambiguous.

# greatsun-dev README

Welcome to the research and development container of the credex ecosystem. Within the container of this repository are tools for running development mode for the credex-core API and the vimbiso-pay client.

This container is managed by an AI avatar called greatsun-dev. The avatar *is* the development environment. It has access to:
  - the full scope of multiple underlying LLMs,
  - our current codebases and commit histories,
  - and the logged conversations that members of the dev team have had with the LLMs.

As a developer in this environment, your job is to express your intent to LLMs, do quality control and verify that the results embody your intent, and submit pull requests when you feel the code is ready to go to the next step of review. Your commits are logged granularly, and so are the conversations with AI models that co-create those commits. With a call/response dialogue with LLMs, you can produce high quality code at an incredibly rapid rate, and this process is the heart of the CI/CD pipeline of the credex ecosystem and also at the heart of our engine for economic modeling.

An LLM is an underlying model, to which every query is a fresh query. This means every query needs to include full context. When you query the LLMs underneath greatsun-dev, we assemble a context and response instructions for the LLM, including your message and optionally a linked file. If the LLM wants to request more context, it informs the codebase, which resends the entire original query, with the requested files attached.

When the LLM responds with recommended code changes, its response is parsed and its recommendations executed as a proposed commit. Review the commit and see if it moves you in the direction that you want to go. Query again if you want changes, or make small edits manually if that's most efficient.

### Commits
As a developer on the Great Sun dev team, you use commits to closely monitor the actions of the avatar and ensure it is proceeding towards your intent. The avatar will overwrite files when you query it, so every commit becomes a reference point for checking the next steps. Commit often, so that every query to the LLM can be checked against a prior commit without an overwhelming number of changes accumulating.

Commits are done in a commonly named and identified commit across all affected repos with the `avatar commit` command to the avatar.

#### Undo
If since the last commit you've made changes that you don't want to lose, and the avatar messes with your code, the undo command works on each file changed to undo the last changes made by the avatar.

### Command line interface
You will communicate with the avatar through a terminal. Responses are logged and recommended actions are saved immediately to files.
- `avatar up` launches the avatar.

#### LLM commands
To send a query to the LLM, which is currently hardcoded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, simply type your message in the terminal and press Enter. The avatar will process your input and interact with the LLM.

#### Shell commands
Specific commands to the avatar will not go to an LLM, but will be processed in-context by code within greatsun-dev. These commands are:
- `avatar commit`: Stages, commits, and pushes current code to all repos with a unified commit message description, and clears the avatar context.
- `avatar clear`: Clears the avatar context and resets it to the initial state.
- `avatar create branch [branch_name]`: Creates a new branch with the specified name across all repositories.
- `avatar checkout [branch_name]`: Checks out the specified branch across all repositories.
- `avatar merge to dev`: Merges the current branch into the dev branch across all repositories.

Exit
- `avatar down` exits the avatar back to the shell. Ctrl-C does the same, more forcefully.

## Project Structure
Our project consists of the following top level directories:

### /avatar
Processing queries to LLMs and their results for developer approval and implementation. LLM instructions and management files, as well as logs.

### /central-logs
Folder to be created for compiling and monitoring logs from the projects in credex-ecosystem and from greatsun-dev.

### /credex-ecosystem
The credex-core API and any clients that need to be tested, developed, or employed in research. These repositories are imported directly into this dev environment, and we make commits together across all impacted repos, including this one.

- Currently under development are:
  - credex-core: our core API on an express.js server.
  - vimbiso-pay: a WhatsApp chatbot written in Python.

### /data-analysis
Folder to be created for tools to analyze existing data in the credex-ecosystem.

### /docs
Documentation for the greatsun-dev environment.

### /simulations
Folder to be created for deploying simulations consisting of patterns of transactions over time for development and research purposes.

### /tests
Folder to be created for unit tests, performance tests, etc.

## Getting started
If you've already set your configuration, just type `avatar up` in the terminal to get started.

## Developer resources
- To configure your environment, see [Configuration](docs/greatsun-dev_configuration.md)

## Current Functions and Features

### LLM Interaction
- The avatar uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the underlying LLM.
- Each interaction with the LLM includes the full context of the conversation and project structure.
- The LLM can request additional context if needed, which is automatically provided by the avatar.

### File Operations
- The avatar can read, write, append, delete, rename, and move files based on LLM recommendations.
- File contents are not displayed in the terminal output for security reasons, but are logged in the conversation thread.
- Directory listings can be performed and new directories can be created.

### Git Operations
- Cross-repository commits: Changes can be committed across all affected repositories with a single command.
- Branch management: Create new branches or checkout existing ones across all repositories simultaneously.
- Merging: Merge changes from the current branch to the dev branch across all repositories.

### Conversation Management
- The avatar maintains a conversation thread that includes the full context of interactions.
- The conversation can be cleared and reset to its initial state using the `avatar clear` command.
- All interactions are logged for future reference and analysis.

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented throughout the system.
- Critical errors are caught, logged, and displayed to the user.
- Detailed logs are maintained for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Developer Input Handling
- The avatar can recognize when developer input is required and prompt the user accordingly.
- Special commands are processed directly by the avatar without involving the LLM.

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive file contents are not displayed in the terminal output.
- The avatar uses placeholders to indicate file operations without revealing content.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of the undo functionality for reverting avatar changes.
- Creation and population of the central-logs, data-analysis, simulations, and tests directories.
- Integration with additional LLMs for diverse AI capabilities.
- Enhanced project management features and reporting tools.

Remember to regularly check for updates to the greatsun-dev environment, as new features and improvements are continuously being added to enhance your development experience.

** INITIAL DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS **

*** DEVELOPER INPUT ***

in this script when it launches the cursor shows up preceded by "None: " how can I change that?

*** LLM RESPONSE ***

To address the issue of the cursor showing up preceded by "None: " when the script launches, we need to examine and modify the main script that handles the user input. This is likely happening in the `avatarUp.py` file. Let's take a look at its contents and make the necessary changes.

<read path="avatar/avatarUp.py" />

Thank you for providing the content of the `avatarUp.py` file. I can see the issue now. The "None: " prefix is likely coming from the `input()` function call. Let's modify the script to change this behavior.

We'll update the `input()` function call to use a custom prompt. Here's how we can modify the relevant part of the script:

I've made the following change to address the issue:

1. In the `main()` function, I've modified the `input()` function call to use a custom prompt. The line now reads:

```python
terminal_input = input(f"{greatsun_developer}: ").strip()
```

This change will make the input prompt show the developer's GitHub username followed by a colon, instead of "None: ".

Now, when you run the script, you should see your GitHub username as the prompt for input, like this:

```
yourusername: 
```

This change should resolve the issue you were experiencing. The "None: " prefix should no longer appear, and instead, you'll see your GitHub username (as defined by the DEVELOPER_GITHUB_USERNAME environment variable) followed by a colon.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain about this change?

*** LLM RESPONSE ***

The change has been successfully made to the `avatarUp.py` file. The input prompt should now display your GitHub username instead of "None: ". This modification should resolve the issue you were experiencing.

To summarize the change:

1. We updated the `input()` function call in the main loop to use the `greatsun_developer` variable, which is set to your GitHub username.
2. The new input prompt will look like `yourusername: `, where `yourusername` is your actual GitHub username as defined by the `DEVELOPER_GITHUB_USERNAME` environment variable.

This change should provide a more personalized and clear prompt for input in your development environment.

Since there's no further input or questions, it seems that the changes we made to the `avatarUp.py` file have successfully resolved the issue with the input prompt. The script should now display your GitHub username instead of "None: " when prompting for input.

To recap what we've done:
1. We identified the issue in the `avatarUp.py` file.
2. We modified the input prompt to use the `greatsun_developer` variable, which contains your GitHub username.
3. The changes were successfully written to the file.

If you want to confirm that everything is working as expected, you can:
1. Restart the avatar script.
2. Check if the new prompt appears correctly with your GitHub username.

If you encounter any issues or need any further assistance with your development environment, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help with any additional questions, coding tasks, or modifications you might need.
