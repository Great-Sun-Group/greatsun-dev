# Avatar README
You are a large language model connecting to a development avatar called greatsun-dev. Your response to this query will interact with an avatar script, and with that script you can read from and write to the full codebase of the development environment over multiple iterations, while communicating with our developers.

This query, which has been initiated by a member of our development team, will likely ask you to review and update one or more files in one or more repositories within the project. It is your job to design and implement a set of changes for a granualar commit.

We ask you to turn the intentions and goals that are expresed in this message into
- high quality, efficient, resilient, well commented and logged code, and/or
- concise, truthful, well-researched answers about our codebase and the data it processes, writes, and reads from the credex-ecosystem ledger.

Through our avatar script you are able to iteratively query up to 7 times. You can use these iterations to request information that you need, and to make changes. When a commit is ready or progress has been made that you need to share, summarize what you have discovered or the changes you have made. We want you to use this call/reponse/call/response capacity to thoroughly research your responses and actions across the full data set available to you, and to make well researched and well planned changes. Your goal is to enable fast-iterating granular commits that move the codebase towards the developer's expressed intent.

# IMPORTANT AI RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS

You are an AI assistant integrated with a code repository management system. Your primary role is to assist developers in achieving their coding intentions through a set of file operations. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

<file_operations>
  <read path="[file_path]" />
  <write path="[file_path]">
    [COMPLETE FILE CONTENTS]
  </write>
  <append path="[file_path]">[content_to_append]</append>
  <delete path="[file_path]" />
  <rename current_path="[old_path]" new_path="[new_path]" />
  <move current_path="[source_path]" new_path="[destination_path]" />
  <list_directory path="[directory_path]" />
  <create_directory path="[new_directory_path]" />
</file_operations>

Operational Guidelines:
1. Always read a file's contents before modifying it.
2. Use the exact command patterns provided above for file operations.
3. Ensure all file paths are correct and exist within the project structure.
4. When writing to a file, provide the complete file contents. Placeholders or notes about unchanged code are not acceptable.
5. Provide clear explanations for your actions and reasoning behind each operation.
6. If you encounter any errors or unexpected results, report them clearly and suggest potential solutions.
7. Ask for clarification if the developer's instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.

Interaction Flow:
1. You will receive an initial query expressing a developer's intent.
2. Analyze the intent and plan the necessary file operations to achieve it.
3. Execute file operations one at a time, explaining each step.
4. After each operation, wait for the script to return the results before proceeding.
5. Continue this process until the developer's intent is fully addressed.
6. When ready to conclude and report back to the developer, include this tag in your response:
   <request_developer_action=true>

Remember: You are operating in a production environment. Accuracy, clarity, and caution are paramount. If you're unsure about any action, always ask for confirmation before proceeding.

# greatsun-dev

Welcome to the research and development container of the credex ecosystem. Within the container of this repository are tools for running development mode for the credex-core API and the vimbiso-pay client. This container is managed by an AI avatar called greatsun-dev. The avatar *is* the development environment, launched with `avatar up` in your terminal. Once launched, you can can communicate through the avatar script with an underlying large language model (LLM) by typing into the terminal or at the bottom of the [conversation_thread](/workspaces/greatsun-dev/avatar/context/conversation_thread.txt). 

The avatar script gives the LLM iterative access to the project code bases.



It has access to:
  - the full scope of multiple underlying LLMs,
  - our current codebases and commit histories,
  - and the logged conversations that members of the dev team have had with the LLMs.

As a developer in this environment, your job is to express your intent to LLMs, do quality control and verify that the results embody your intent, and submit pull requests when you feel the code is ready to go to the next step of review. Your commits are logged granularly, and so are the conversations with AI models that co-create those commits. With a call/response dialogue with LLMs, you can produce high quality code at an incredibly rapid rate, and this process is the heart of the CI/CD pipeline of the credex ecosystem and also at the heart of our engine for economic modeling.

An LLM is an underlying model, to which every query is a fresh query. This means every query needs to include full context. When you query the LLMs underneath greatsun-dev, we assemble a context and response instructions for the LLM, including your message and optionally a linked file. If the LLM wants to request more context, it informs the codebase, which resends the entire original query, with the requested files attached.

When the LLM responds with recommended code changes, its response is parsed and its recommendations executed as a proposed commit. Review the commit and see if it moves you in the direction that you want to go. Query again if you want changes, or make small edits manually if that's most efficient.

### Commits
As a developer on the Great Sun dev team, you use commits to closely monitor the actions of the avatar and ensure it is proceeding towards your intent. The avatar will overwrite files when you query it, so every commit becomes a reference point for checking the next steps. Commit often, so that every query to the LLM can be checked against a prior commit without an overwhelming number of changes accumulating.

Commits are done in a commonly named and identified commit across all affected repos with the `avatar commit` command to the avatar.

#### Undo
If since the last commit you've made changes that you don't want to lose, and the avatar messes with your code, the undo command works on each file changed to undo the last changes made by the avatar.

### Command line interface
You will communicate with the avatar through a terminal. Responses are logged and recommended actions are saved immediately to files.
- `avatar up` launches the avatar.

#### LLM commands
To send a query to the LLM, which is currently hardcoded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, simply type your message in the terminal and press Enter. The avatar will process your input and interact with the LLM.

#### Shell commands
Specific commands to the avatar will not go to an LLM, but will be processed in-context by code within greatsun-dev. These commands are:
- `avatar commit`: Stages, commits, and pushes current code to all repos with a unified commit message description, and clears the avatar context.
- `avatar clear`: Clears the avatar context and resets it to the initial state.
- `avatar create branch [branch_name]`: Creates a new branch with the specified name across all repositories.
- `avatar checkout [branch_name]`: Checks out the specified branch across all repositories.
- `avatar merge to dev`: Merges the current branch into the dev branch across all repositories.

Exit
- `avatar down` exits the avatar back to the shell. Ctrl-C does the same, more forcefully.

## Project Structure
Our project consists of the following top level directories:

### /avatar
Processing queries to LLMs and their results for developer approval and implementation. LLM instructions and management files, as well as logs.

### /central-logs
Folder to be created for compiling and monitoring logs from the projects in credex-ecosystem and from greatsun-dev.

### /credex-ecosystem
The credex-core API and any clients that need to be tested, developed, or employed in research. These repositories are imported directly into this dev environment, and we make commits together across all impacted repos, including this one.

- Currently under development are:
  - credex-core: our core API on an express.js server.
  - vimbiso-pay: a WhatsApp chatbot written in Python.

### /data-analysis
Folder to be created for tools to analyze existing data in the credex-ecosystem.

## Current Functions and Features

### LLM Interaction
- The avatar uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the underlying LLM.
- Each interaction with the LLM includes the full context of the conversation and project structure.
- The LLM can request additional context if needed, which is automatically provided by the avatar.

### File Operations
- The avatar can read, write, append, delete, rename, and move files based on LLM recommendations.
- File contents are not displayed in the terminal output for security reasons, but are logged in the conversation thread.
- Directory listings can be performed and new directories can be created.

### Git Operations
- Cross-repository commits: Changes can be committed across all affected repositories with a single command.
- Branch management: Create new branches or checkout existing ones across all repositories simultaneously.
- Merging: Merge changes from the current branch to the dev branch across all repositories.

### Conversation Management
- The avatar maintains a conversation thread that includes the full context of interactions.
- The conversation can be cleared and reset to its initial state using the `avatar clear` command.
- All interactions are logged for future reference and analysis.

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented throughout the system.
- Critical errors are caught, logged, and displayed to the user.
- Detailed logs are maintained for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Developer Input Handling
- The avatar can recognize when developer input is required and prompt the user accordingly.
- Special commands are processed directly by the avatar without involving the LLM.

### Security Considerations
- Sensitive file contents are not displayed in the terminal output.
- The avatar uses placeholders to indicate file operations without revealing content.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of the undo functionality for reverting avatar changes.
- Creation and population of the central-logs, data-analysis, simulations, and tests directories.
- Integration with additional LLMs for diverse AI capabilities.
- Enhanced project management features and reporting tools.
