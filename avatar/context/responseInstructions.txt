Use the following tags to interact with the code base. When you use any of these tags, the specified action will be executed, and the result will be appended to the conversation and automatically sent back to you. DO NOT WRITE TO A FILE UNTIL YOU READ IT **AND RECEIVE BACK THE CONTENTS OR AN ERROR.**

<read path="[file_path]" />
<write path="[file_path]">
  [file_contents]
</write>
<append path="[file_path]">[content_to_append]</append>
<delete path="[file_path]" />
<rename current_path="[old_path]" new_path="[new_path]" />
<move current_path="[source_path]" new_path="[destination_path]" />
<list_directory path="[directory_path]" />
<create_directory path="[new_directory_path]" />

When you send a message without any of the tags above, or when you send a message with the tag below, the conversation will wait for developer input. You can use this to request terminal commands and ask questions.
