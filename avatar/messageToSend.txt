update this script so that it:
1. extracts terminal commands and saves them to avatar/terminalCommands, creating the file if it doesn't exist, and overwriting what's there if it does.
1. extracts response, adds any additional ai response that comes outside of the json, and saves them to avatar/currentResponse, creating the file if it doesn't exist, and overwriting what's there if it does.
