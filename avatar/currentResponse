To update the `read_summary_of_context` function to import the logs from the last 15 minutes, we can modify the function as follows:

Additional information:
To incorporate the logs from the last 15 minutes, I've added a new function `read_recent_logs` that reads the log files in the `avatar/context/conversationLog` directory from the last 15 minutes. It sorts the log files by name (which is the date), calculates the datetime 15 minutes ago, and then reads the contents of any log files created after that time.

The `read_summary_of_context` function now calls `read_recent_logs` and concatenates the recent logs to provide context when reading the summary file.

Note: This assumes that the log files are named with the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.log`. If the naming convention is different, you'll need to update the code accordingly.
