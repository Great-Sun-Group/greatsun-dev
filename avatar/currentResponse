To import and use the utility functions from utils.py in avatarUp.py, follow these steps:

1. Import the required functions from utils.py at the top of avatarUp.py:

from utils import read_file_content, write_to_file, read_summary_of_context, write_summary_of_context, get_directory_tree

2. Replace the corresponding function definitions in avatarUp.py with the imported functions from utils.py.

3. Update any calls to these functions in avatarUp.py to use the imported versions.

Additional information:
The main changes made:

1. Imported the required functions from `utils.py` at the top of `avatarUp.py`.
2. Removed the function definitions for `read_file_content`, `write_to_file`, `read_summary_of_context`, `write_summary_of_context`, and `get_directory_tree` from `avatarUp.py` since they are now being imported from `utils.py`.
3. Updated any calls to these functions in `avatarUp.py` to use the imported versions.

The `avatarUp.py` script now uses the utility functions defined in `utils.py` instead of declaring them locally. This helps to keep the code organized and modular, making it easier to maintain and update in the future.
