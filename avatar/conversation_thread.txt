# Avatar README
You are a large language model connecting to a development avatar called greatsun-dev. Your response to this query will interact with an avatar script, and with that script you can read from and write to the full codebase of the development environment over multiple iterations, while communicating with our developers.

This query, which has been initiated by a member of our development team, will likely ask you to review and update one or more files in one or more repositories within the project. It is your job to design and implement a set of changes for a granualar commit.

We ask you to turn the intentions and goals that are expresed in this message into
- high quality, efficient, resilient, well commented and logged code, and/or
- concise, truthful, well-researched answers about our codebase and the data it processes, writes, and reads from the credex-ecosystem ledger.

Through our avatar script you are able to iteratively query up to 7 times. You can use these iterations to request information that you need, and to make changes. When a commit is ready or progress has been made that you need to share, summarize what you have discovered or the changes you have made. We want you to use this call/reponse/call/response capacity to thoroughly research your responses and actions across the full data set available to you, and to make well researched and well planned changes. Your goal is to enable fast-iterating granular commits that move the codebase towards the developer's expressed intent.

# IMPORTANT AI RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONSYou are an AI assistant integrated with a code repository management system. Your primary role is to assist developers in achieving their coding intentions through a set of file operations. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

<file_operations>
  <read path="[file_path]" />
  <write path="[file_path]">
    [COMPLETE FILE CONTENTS]
  </write>
  <append path="[file_path]">[content_to_append]</append>
  <delete path="[file_path]" />
  <rename current_path="[old_path]" new_path="[new_path]" />
  <move current_path="[source_path]" new_path="[destination_path]" />
  <list_directory path="[directory_path]" />
  <create_directory path="[new_directory_path]" />
</file_operations>

Operational Guidelines:
1. Always read a file's contents before modifying it.
2. Use the exact command patterns provided above for file operations.
3. Ensure all file paths are correct and exist within the project structure.
4. When writing to a file, provide the complete file contents. Placeholders or notes about unchanged code are not acceptable.
5. Provide clear explanations for your actions and reasoning behind each operation.
6. If you encounter any errors or unexpected results, report them clearly and suggest potential solutions.
7. Ask for clarification if the developer's instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.

Interaction Flow:
1. You will receive an initial query expressing a developer's intent.
2. Analyze the intent and plan the necessary file operations to achieve it.
3. Execute file operations one at a time, explaining each step.
4. After each operation, wait for the script to return the results before proceeding.
5. Continue this process until the developer's intent is fully addressed.
6. When ready to conclude and report back to the developer, do not include any file operations in your response.

Remember: You are operating in a production environment. Accuracy, clarity, and caution are paramount. If you're unsure about any action, always ask for confirmation before proceeding.

# greatsun-dev

Welcome to the research and development container of the credex ecosystem. Within the container of this repository are tools for running development, admin, and research modes for the credex-core API, the vimbiso-pay client, and additional clients that will we'll soon be working on, such as a web app for customer service agents and an economic modelling tool.

This container is managed by an AI "avatar" interface called greatsun-dev. The avatar *is* the development environment. It is launched in your terminal to enable you to communicate through our avatar scripts with large language model (LLM) artificial intelligences.

We are currently connecting to Anthropic's latest version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which has impressive "agentic" coding abilities. But the avatar script is not tied to a single LLM. In fact, the intention is to eventually integrate several models and send queries wherever is appropriate, or even to more than one LLM to compare responses. We will also be able to use this integrated LLM interface in apps we build, giving our members, clients, and customers direct access to this approach within their own context, for tasks beyond coding.

GitHub repositories and other data can be synced into the greatsun-dev container as submodules. Within the container, the avatar script gives the LLM iterative access to code bases, files, and directories to read, write, etc. As a developer working in the greatsun-dev environment, your role is to express intent to the avatar, check the code it delivers and operations it executes, make manual edits or request changes, confirm commits, and test functionality.

Your interface with the greatsun-dev avatar is at the heart of our CI/CD pipeline. With the avatar scripts opening a trilateral channel of communication and action between yourself, the artificial intelligence, and our code base, you will be able to rapidly deliver high quality code into our review, testing and deployment process.

## Implementing Your Intention
You express your intention, and the LLM uses the avatar to carry it out. Claude and the other LLMs we will use have potent and rapidly increasing capacities to handle high level abstractions and multi-step logic. When we share a purpose at a high level, the AI can assist at that level. The assistance provided is not limited to working with single lines of code, functions, or files. You can describe entire feature branches to the avatar, rapidly generate detailed work plans, and use those plans to advance the avatar through complex, multi step tasks quickly and efficiently.

To excel as a member of the greatsun-dev team:
1. stay aware of the current state, and oriented to your goal state,
2. ask good questions and probe for the most direct path,
3. use the avatar to research possibilities and help analyze options,
4. clearly state your high level plan with as many specifics as possible,
5. initiate and/or approve specific tasks,
6. review results to ensure that they move you towards your goal,
7. and test and verify because at the end of the day, you are responsible for the code you sign off on.

Every dev in this space is a project manager.

### Developer Intent #1: Current Project
The avatar automatically prepares context for the LLM. As a developer, you have two places to express your intent into this context. The first place is in the [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) file. When you first enter the greatsun-dev environment, instead of grabbing a task off the current project, create your own at the bottom:
```
# But First Must Do
Get a 30 minute guided tour of greatsun-dev and the credex-ecosystem software.
```

#### Getting Started
To configure your environment, see [Configuration](docs/greatsun-dev_configuration.md). Then either:
  1. open a Codespace on `dev` or on the main branch of the project you are working on, or
  2. clone the repository locally, then
  3. launch the avatar:

  - `avatar up`: activates the avatar scripts and creates and checks out a new branch if you are on a primary branch.
    - The avatar treats branches named 'dev' or ending in '-project' as primary branches. If you are on a primary branch when you call `avatar up`, the branch for your work will be forked from that primary, and off you go.

  - `avatar load`: pulls all submodules from a remote branch to your local/codespace.
    - you need to `avatar load` on a new branch from dev to load the submodules for the first time, and you can use it to pull the latest from dev or a project branch. (test for behaviour vis-a-vis local changes. does it overwrite stashed changes?)

### Developer Intent #2: Message From Developer
The second place to express your intent is in the Message From Developer. You will initiate the conversation with the first instruction you give, and you can continue a back and forth with the LLM through the avatar. There are two ways you can communicate through the avatar. After `avatar up`, then:
  1. Enter simple queries or instructions in the terminal, and/or
  2. Enter more complex queries or instructions at the bottom of the [conversation_thread](avatar/conversation_thread.txt) file, under Message From Developer.

Press enter in the terminal.

Whatever is in the terminal will be appended to whatever is in the conversation thread and sent to the LLM. Take a look through [conversation_thread](avatar/conversation_thread.txt) to see the full conversation that you are in with the avatar, including file contents sent back and forth. A sanitized version is printed to the terminal with the file contents removed for better human readibility. (this broke, needs to be fixed. currently no terminal printing.)

### Stepping Towards Your Goal
You can use `avatar refresh` any time to restart the conversation with the context of the repo and project reassembled from the current files. You then add your intention for this specific conversation with the avatar and LLM into the Developer Instructions as above, and then work with the tool to deliver code.

The LLM can get confused if the conversation thread gets too long, if there are repetitive tweaks on the same bug going back and forth, or if multiple topics or priorities enter the thread.

Steps towards your goal are measured by the cadence of this one-conversation-at-a-time model. It's the developer's job to ensure that these iterations drive progress at a strategic level. The difference between the [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) and Message From Developer is that the project will remain largly the same with small changes every time you `avatar refresh`, whereas the content of the messages back and for will leave the active memory of the avatar. Those messages are saved in conversation_thread in your commit, to be overwritten with the next commit but preserved in the repository history of greatsun-dev.

#### Independent Mini Steps
An unexpected but repeatedly established behaviour of the avatar is that when it has simple questions or wants a simple confirmation from you, it will respond to itself on your behalf. Within its response it will literally print the heading indicating your response, put words in your mouth confirming approving some minor decision it was asking about, and then proceeding with the recommendd action as if you had actually approved it.

Let's keep an eye on this behaviour, but so far the avatar usually knows to stop for important questions or when it reaches the end of its task. But this behaviour increases the chances of the script running off down a track that you do not actually intend. Always check the code before you stage and commit it.

### Entering Your First Developer Instruction
Enter something like this in the terminal or conversation thread:
```
let's get started on my guided tour. recommend a plan to complete it in 30 minutes.
```
Review the results, make any edits you see fit, or clarify your instructions and try again. Or move to the next step, like:
```
save that to the current project file
```
Chances are that's already been done on the avatar's initiative. But if not, you can request it.

## Source Control Panel
You can always stage your current state before you query the avatar, so that you can track against the changes in source control. Then when you have the changes staged for your next step forward:

  - `avatar commit`: Commits and pushes current code to all affected repos with a unified branch name and commit message.

You've now got a workplan for the next 30 minutes stored in Current Project, so `avatar refresh` both to clear the conversation and to refresh the project description being sent. With a fresh and up-to-date context, you can use the workplan in [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) to move forward towards your intent. The avatar can easily reference it and step through it with commands like:
```
execute the next step in the current project
```

When the avatar pauses to await your response or next instructions, you can continue the conversation with another Developer Instruction in the terminal and/or at the bottom of the [conversation_thread](/workspaces/greatsun-dev/avatar/conversation_thread.txt), or you can use any of the 'avatar' commands.

## Branches and Commits
The avatar unifies and links your commits across all repositories, including this one. Get started on a new project by pulling the latest from 'dev' to your local or launching a codespace off 'dev' from GitHub, or launch on an existing project branch. Once your development container is live, `avatar up` for a new branch to be created for you if you are on one of these primary banches. If you launch from a branch other than 'dev' or a branch ending in '-project', your launch branch will be maintained into the avatar.

Don't hesitate to commit regularly. Multiple untested commits that move you towards your objective are expected, with testing more likely to be done on a series of commits than on each one. Staging changes can also be very helpful. You want to be able to lock in every step, and if too many changes build up you can lose it all if a wobble develops in the LLM's capacity and it makes a crazy write. Don't save your progress where it is subject to the whims of the avatar, save it in a trail of granular commits. You want to be able to refresh the context any time without significant loss of progress.

### Commit conversation_thread.txt with every commit
In order to track progress and performance of AI models, and provide insight into effective and productive query patterns, please commit your automatically updated conversation_thread.txt file with every commit.

### Two Tricks
1. If you are in the middle of a productive thread and something goes wrong, you can delete content out of the conversation_thread and restart from whatever point you want.
2. The handy undo:
 - `avatar stepback` undoes your last commit, bringing it back into staged changes whenever you need a do-over. Can be done repetitively to step way back if necessary. *(to be built)*

## Running services
All imported modules are brought online in dev mode with:
  - `avatar engage`: fires up the submodule servers.

## Intent Achieved
Once you have acheived your intent and tested your code for a feature, fix, or task:

  - `avatar submit`: Option `<project>` pushes your branches to remote, and requests a merge into a -project branch, creating it if it doesn't exist. *(buggy, do not use yet)*

Projects will consist of one or more merges from a team member's branches, with each commit possibly linked to other commits across greatsun-dev and/or the submodules. When the project (feature, fix, or refactor) is ready, it will be merged to dev, one repository at a time using GitHub web.

Once you've submitted your branch, take a new branch of the project or off dev if your project is finished, and continue your work towards the next goal.

  - **On codespaces:** close the window and create a new codespace on greatsun-dev, dev branch or your project branch.
  - **On local:** switch branches on greatsun-dev with `git checkout <dev or project-branch>`. *(to test)*

Run `avatar up` then `avatar load` for dev or your project branch, then `avatar refresh` and you are ready to go.

  - `avatar down` exits back to the terminal.

## List of Commands
Everything listed above in one place for reference:
  - `avatar up`: activates the script and creates and checks out a new branch if you are on dev.
  - `avatar refresh`: reloads the conversation from current files.
  - `avatar load`: pulls all submodules from a remote branch to your local/codespace.
  - `avatar engage`: fires up the submodule servers.
  - `avatar commit`: Commits and pushes current code to all affected repos with a unified commit message.
  - `avatar stepback` undoes your last commit, bringing it back into staged changes whenever you need a do-over. Can be done repetitively to step way back if necessary. *(to be built)*
  - `avatar submit`: Option `<project>` pushes your branches to remote, and requests a merge into a -project branch, creating it if it doesn't exist. *(buggy, do not use yet)*
  - `avatar down` exits the shell.

# Credex Ecosystem Core API

The credex ecosystem is a shared ledger that enables the efficient circulation of value, accumulation of capital, investment of profits, and giving of gifts. It is a tool for financial inclusion, financial empowerment, and financial sovereignty.

## Credex Principle

**If I owe you,**\
**and you owe them,**\
**and they owe me,**\
**we're square.**

The credex ecosystem actualizes the Credex Principle in the Minute Transaction Queue (MTQ), which tracks payable and receivable invoices for members' accounts, finds loops of value creation, and cancels payable and receivable invoices against each other in "credloops" in which every debt is reduced by an equal value. This is a GAAP-compliant accounting process that any person or business can benefit from.

In accounting terms, a credex is a contingent asset for one party and a contingent liability for the other. These asset/liability pairs are automatically strung together into credloops wherever possible across the credex ecosystem. When a credloop is created and cleared, every account in the loop will have an accounts payable invoice cancelled against an equivalent accounts receivable invoice.

## Credcoin Principle

**Every human is entitled to one equal share of the value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy.**\
**Every human is responsible to provide value equal to the amount of natural wealth that they consume.**

The ecosystem actualizes the Credcoin Principle in the Daily Credcoin Offering (DCO), which updates exchange rates across the ecosystem daily. Every 24h, the DCO makes this equation true: one credcoin today equals the number of members participating in the DCO today divided by the value of natural wealth entering the organic economy through the DCO today.

The organic economy is a subset of the credex ecosystem, which is a subset of the global economy, which is the human-enhanced subset of the world that is given to us by nature. The organic economy is an economy in which wealth circulates, profit accumulates, investment is made, and gifts are given in alignment and long-term harmony with the biological environment of our habitat and the physical laws that bind us.

The value of the natural wealth processed by the DCO is split into two portions: gift portion and market portion. Currently, in the MVP version we've developed in this repository, only the gift portion of the DCO is implemented. The market portion will be added later.

The credex ecosystem stores values in credcoin (CXX). In order to natively enable multi-denominational accounting, a CXXmultiplier value is stored alongside every CXX value. Both of these values are updated in every DCO so that the credex remains true to the face value in the denomination specified, and to other values stored in the ecosystem. A value expressed in CXX represents that value in relationship to every other value stored in the ecosystem. A value in CXX divided by its CXX multiplier expresses the value in the chosen denomination (face value).

The system manages the balance between local truth (preserving the face value of contracts in their specified denomination) and global truth (adjusting all values relative to credcoin) through the daily rate and value adjustments in the DCO.

## Neo4j databases

Credex-core runs on two neo4j databases. LedgerSpace is the shared ledger containing the full state of the credex ecosystem. SearchSpace contains only unredeemed credexes, and is optimized to find credloops. On every credloop found and cleared, ledgerSpace is updated accordingly.

## Express.js server

The express.js server is initialized in `src/index.ts`, which provides the cronjobs and endpoints that power the ecosystem and enable members and client apps to interact with its ledger.

## Cronjobs

The Core module hosts the cronjobs:

- DailyCredcoinOffering() runs every day at midnight UTC.
- MinuteTransactionQueue() runs every minute, clearing credloops of value creation across the ecosystem.

## Endpoints

Controllers for the endpoints are imported, and endpoints created for the various modules: Member, Account, Avatar, Credex, and AdminDashboard.

## Development Setup

Development for the credex-core repository and API is intended to be carried out in the [greatsun-dev](https://github.com/Great-Sun-Group/greatsun-dev) environment.

# Current Project

## End State
Production-ready mvps of credex-core and vimbiso-pay are realeased.

## Current State
Greatsun-dev container mostly operational, avatar script still buggy. Submodule servers confirmed running on local ports, but not tested.

## Next Steps Planned

Test all main member action flows with simulation scripts.

- Move simulation scripts from vimbiso-pay to greatsun-dev

- Test WhatsApp Simulation Interface
   - Thoroughly test the `simulate_user.py` script to ensure it accurately simulates WhatsApp interactions.
   - Verify that all types of messages (text, interactive, etc.) are handled correctly.
   - Test error handling and edge cases in the simulation.

- Enhance Interactive Message Handling
   - Implement proper display and handling of interactive messages (e.g., buttons, list options).
   - Ensure that user responses to interactive messages are correctly processed.

- Currently experiencing issues in the VimbisoPay Terminal simulator, specifically in the files:
   - `/workspaces/vimbiso-pay/app/core/api/tests/VimbisoPay_Terminal.py`
   - `/workspaces/vimbiso-pay/app/core/api/api_interactions.py`
   - Error Handling:
      - The script is not gracefully handling API errors, leading to unhandled exceptions.
   - Missing Attribute:
      - AttributeError: 'CredexBotService' object has no attribute 'utils'.
   - To focus on:
      - Improving error handling in the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py`.
      - Adding the missing 'utils' attribute to the CredexBotService class or removing references to it.
      - Implementing proper message routing and handling for specific user inputs in `VimbisoPay_Terminal.py`.


*** MESSAGE FROM DEVELOPER @ryanlukewatson ***

I've just moved vimbisopay_terminal to a new location in the tests folder of the main repo from the vimbiso-pay submodule. We need to get it up and running and able to query vimbiso-pay in dev mode, which will then query credex-core and return the info to the vimbisopay_terminal. analyze the code and make a plan.

```

The `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script is a command-line interface that simulates the VimbisoPay chatbot. It allows users to perform various actions such as sending money, requesting money, viewing offers, checking balances, and viewing their profile.

The `api_interactions.py` module provides a class `APIInteractions` that handles interactions with the VimbisoPay API. It includes methods for fetching member information, getting member balances and offers, sending and requesting money, and accepting or declining offers.

To get the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script up and running and able to query the `vimbiso-pay` submodule in dev mode, which will then query the `credex-core` submodule and return the information to the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Error Handling**: The scripts are not gracefully handling API errors, leading to unhandled exceptions. We need to improve error handling in the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py`.

2. **Missing Attribute**: The `VimbisoPay_Terminal` class in `vimbisopay_terminal.py` is trying to access the `utils` attribute of the `CredexBotService` class, which doesn't seem to exist. We need to either add the missing `utils` attribute to the `CredexBotService` class or remove the references to it.

3. **Message Routing and Handling**: The `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script needs to implement proper message routing and handling for specific user inputs. Currently, it only prints the available screens and prompts for user input, but it doesn't handle the user input correctly.

Here's a plan to address these issues:

1. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - In `api_interactions.py`, modify the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods to handle exceptions more gracefully.
   - Consider logging errors instead of printing them to the console.
   - Implement error handling for specific HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server error).

2. **Fix Missing Attribute**:
   - Investigate the `CredexBotService` class and its dependencies to determine if the `utils` attribute should exist or not.
   - If the `utils` attribute is required, add it to the `CredexBotService` class and import the necessary modules.
   - If the `utils` attribute is not required, remove the references to it in `vimbisopay_terminal.py`.

3. **Implement Message Routing and Handling**:
   - In `vimbisopay_terminal.py`, modify the `run` method to handle user input correctly.
   - Create separate methods for handling different user inputs (e.g., `handle_send_money`, `handle_request_money`, `handle_offers`, `handle_balance`, `handle_profile`).
   - Call the appropriate method based on the user input and the current screen.
   - Implement the logic for each action handler method, making use of the `APIInteractions` class to interact with the VimbisoPay API.

4. **Set up Development Environment**:
   - Ensure that the `vimbiso-pay` and `credex-core` submodules are properly set up and running in dev mode.
   - Configure the `VIMBISO_PAY_API_URL` constant in `api_interactions.py` to point to the correct local development server URL.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the `APIInteractions` class to ensure that the API interactions are working correctly.
   - Test the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script by running it and simulating different user inputs and actions.
   - Verify that the script is able to communicate with the `vimbiso-pay` submodule and retrieve the expected data from the `credex-core` submodule.

By following this plan, we should be able to get the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script up and running, properly handling errors, fixing the missing attribute issue, and implementing correct message routing and handling. Additionally, we'll ensure that the script can communicate with the `vimbiso-pay` and `credex-core` submodules in the development environment.

# Current Project

## End State
Production-ready mvps of credex-core and vimbiso-pay are realeased.

## Current State
Greatsun-dev container mostly operational, avatar script still buggy. Submodule servers confirmed running on local ports, but not tested.

## Next Steps Planned

Test all main member action flows with simulation scripts.

- Move simulation scripts from vimbiso-pay to greatsun-dev

- Test WhatsApp Simulation Interface
   - Thoroughly test the `simulate_user.py` script to ensure it accurately simulates WhatsApp interactions.
   - Verify that all types of messages (text, interactive, etc.) are handled correctly.
   - Test error handling and edge cases in the simulation.

- Enhance Interactive Message Handling
   - Implement proper display and handling of interactive messages (e.g., buttons, list options).
   - Ensure that user responses to interactive messages are correctly processed.

- Fix issues in the VimbisoPay Terminal simulator:
   - Improve error handling in the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py`.
   - Add the missing 'utils' attribute to the CredexBotService class or remove references to it.
   - Implement proper message routing and handling for specific user inputs in `VimbisoPay_Terminal.py`.

- Set up Development Environment:
   - Ensure that the `vimbiso-pay` and `credex-core` submodules are properly set up and running in dev mode.
   - Configure the `VIMBISO_PAY_API_URL` constant in `api_interactions.py` to point to the correct local development server URL.

- Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the `APIInteractions` class to ensure that the API interactions are working correctly.
   - Test the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script by running it and simulating different user inputs and actions.
   - Verify that the script is able to communicate with the `vimbiso-pay` submodule and retrieve the expected data from the `credex-core` submodule.

*** MESSAGE FROM DEVELOPER @ryanlukewatson ***

I've just moved vimbisopay_terminal to a new location in the tests folder of the main repo from the vimbiso-pay submodule. We need to get it up and running and able to query vimbiso-pay in dev mode, which will then query credex-core and return the info to the vimbisopay_terminal. analyze the code and make a plan.

*** RESPONSE FROM ASSISTANT ***

I have analyzed the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script and the `api_interactions.py` module. The `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script is a command-line interface that simulates the VimbisoPay chatbot, allowing users to perform various actions such as sending money, requesting money, viewing offers, checking balances, and viewing their profile. The `api_interactions.py` module provides a class `APIInteractions` that handles interactions with the VimbisoPay API.

To get the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script up and running and able to query the `vimbiso-pay` submodule in dev mode, which will then query the `credex-core` submodule and return the information to the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script, we need to address the following issues:

1. **Error Handling**: The scripts are not gracefully handling API errors, leading to unhandled exceptions. We need to improve error handling in the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py`.

2. **Missing Attribute**: The `VimbisoPay_Terminal` class in `vimbisopay_terminal.py` is trying to access the `utils` attribute of the `CredexBotService` class, which doesn't seem to exist. We need to either add the missing `utils` attribute to the `CredexBotService` class or remove the references to it.

3. **Message Routing and Handling**: The `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script needs to implement proper message routing and handling for specific user inputs. Currently, it only prints the available screens and prompts for user input, but it doesn't handle the user input correctly.

Here's a plan to address these issues:

1. **Improve Error Handling**:

*** LLM RESPONSE ***

I have updated the `current_project.md` file with the plan to get the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script up and running, and able to communicate with the `vimbiso-pay` and `credex-core` submodules in the development environment. The plan includes the following steps:

1. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Modify the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py` to handle exceptions more gracefully.
   - Consider logging errors instead of printing them to the console.
   - Implement error handling for specific HTTP status codes.

2. **Fix Missing Attribute**:
   - Investigate the `CredexBotService` class and its dependencies to determine if the `utils` attribute should exist or not.
   - If the `utils` attribute is required, add it to the `CredexBotService` class and import the necessary modules.
   - If the `utils` attribute is not required, remove the references to it in `vimbisopay_terminal.py`.

3. **Implement Message Routing and Handling**:
   - Modify the `run` method in `vimbisopay_terminal.py` to handle user input correctly.
   - Create separate methods for handling different user inputs.
   - Call the appropriate method based on the user input and the current screen.
   - Implement the logic for each action handler method, making use of the `APIInteractions` class to interact with the VimbisoPay API.

4. **Set up Development Environment**:
   - Ensure that the `vimbiso-pay` and `credex-core` submodules are properly set up and running in dev mode.
   - Configure the `VIMBISO_PAY_API_URL` constant in `api_interactions.py` to point to the correct local development server URL.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the `APIInteractions` class to ensure that the API interactions are working correctly.
   - Test the `vimbisopay_terminal.py` script by running it and simulating different user inputs and actions.
   - Verify that the script is able to communicate with the `vimbiso-pay` submodule and retrieve the expected data from the `credex-core` submodule.

Additionally, the plan includes testing the WhatsApp simulation interface (`simulate_user.py` script) and enhancing the interactive message handling in the `vimbiso-pay` submodule.

Please review the updated `current_project.md` file and let me know if you need any further assistance or have additional instructions.
