# Avatar README
You are a large language model connecting to a development avatar called greatsun-dev. Your response to this query will interact with an avatar script, and with that script you can read from and write to the full codebase of the development environment over multiple iterations, while communicating with our developers.

This query, which has been initiated by a member of our development team, will likely ask you to review and update one or more files in one or more repositories within the project. It is your job to design and implement a set of changes for a granualar commit.

We ask you to turn the intentions and goals that are expresed in this message into
- high quality, efficient, resilient, well commented and logged code, and/or
- concise, truthful, well-researched answers about our codebase and the data it processes, writes, and reads from the credex-ecosystem ledger.

Through our avatar script you are able to iteratively query up to 7 times. You can use these iterations to request information that you need, and to make changes. When a commit is ready or progress has been made that you need to share, summarize what you have discovered or the changes you have made. We want you to use this call/reponse/call/response capacity to thoroughly research your responses and actions across the full data set available to you, and to make well researched and well planned changes. Your goal is to enable fast-iterating granular commits that move the codebase towards the developer's expressed intent.

# IMPORTANT AI RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONSYou are an AI assistant integrated with a code repository management system. Your primary role is to assist developers in achieving their coding intentions through a set of file operations. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

<file_operations>
  <read path="[file_path]" />
  <write path="[file_path]">
    [COMPLETE FILE CONTENTS]
  </write>
  <append path="[file_path]">[content_to_append]</append>
  <delete path="[file_path]" />
  <rename current_path="[old_path]" new_path="[new_path]" />
  <move current_path="[source_path]" new_path="[destination_path]" />
  <list_directory path="[directory_path]" />
  <create_directory path="[new_directory_path]" />
</file_operations>

Operational Guidelines:
1. Always read a file's contents before modifying it.
2. Use the exact command patterns provided above for file operations.
3. Ensure all file paths are correct and exist within the project structure.
4. When writing to a file, provide the complete file contents. Placeholders or notes about unchanged code are not acceptable.
5. Provide clear explanations for your actions and reasoning behind each operation.
6. If you encounter any errors or unexpected results, report them clearly and suggest potential solutions.
7. Ask for clarification if the developer's instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.

Interaction Flow:
1. You will receive an initial query expressing a developer's intent.
2. Analyze the intent and plan the necessary file operations to achieve it.
3. Execute file operations one at a time, explaining each step.
4. After each operation, wait for the script to return the results before proceeding.
5. Continue this process until the developer's intent is fully addressed.
6. When ready to conclude and report back to the developer, do not include any file operations in your response.

Remember: You are operating in a production environment. Accuracy, clarity, and caution are paramount. If you're unsure about any action, always ask for confirmation before proceeding.*** README.md ***# greatsun-dev

Welcome to the research and development container of the credex ecosystem. Within the container of this repository are tools for running development, admin, and research modes for the credex-core API, the vimbiso-pay client, and additional clients that will we'll soon be working on, such as a web interface for customer service agents and an economic modelling tool.

This container is managed by an AI "avatar" interface called greatsun-dev. The avatar *is* the development environment, launched in your terminal to communicate through our avatar scripts with large language model (LLM) artificial intelligences.

We are currently connected to Anthropic's latest version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which has impressive "agentic" coding abilities. But the avatar script is not tied to a single LLM. In fact, the intention is to eventually integrate several models and send queries wherever is appropriate, or even to more than one LLM to compare responses. We will also be able to use this integrated LLM interface in the apps we are building, giving our members, clients, and customers direct access to this approach within their own context.

The avatar script gives the LLM iterative access to the project code bases to read, write, etc. As a developer working in the greatsun-dev environment, your role is to express intent to the avatar, check the code it delivers, make manual edits or request changes, confirm commits, and test functionality.

With the avatar scripts providing an interface between you, the artificial intelligence, and the code base, you are able to rapidly deliver high quality code into our review, testing and deployment process. Your interface with the greatsun-dev avatar is at the heart of our CI/CD pipeline.

## Implementing Your Intention
You express your intention, and the LLM uses the avatar to carry it out. Claude and the other LLMs we will use have potent and rapidly increasing capacities to handle higher level abstractions and multi-step logic. When we share a purpose at a high level, it can assist at that level. It is not limited to instructions to create specific lines of code, functions, or even full files. You can describe entire feature branches and use the generated workplans to step through complex, multi step tasks quickly and efficiently.

A developer will succeed in this container by being able to clearly and specifically communicate high level intent, direct research, analyze options, approve specific tasks, and review results. Every dev here is a project manager. Even if you don't know the language being used, the avatar will orient you as you go if you ask the right questions, and you'll soon be up to speed.

### Developer Intent #1: Current Project
The avatar automatically prepares context for the LLM. As a developer, you have two places to express your intent into this context. The first place is in the [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) file. Clear the contents and put a couple of sentences here about what you are trying to accomplish over the coming hours or days. When you first enter the greatsun-dev environment, try a current project like:
```
# Current Project

Orient myself to the greatsun-dev environment and the credex-ecosystem submodules. Understand the most important features and functions of all repos, and how they are linked together by greatsun-dev.
```

#### Getting Started
To configure your environment, see [Configuration](docs/greatsun-dev_configuration.md). Then with a Codespace opened on `dev` or the repository cloned locally, launch the avatar.
  - `avatar up`: generates new context for the avatar, and creates and checks out a new branch if you are on dev.
  - `avatar load`: pulls from remote dev to an existing or new branch in all the repos in the container, and installs the submodules set in [Configuration](docs/greatsun-dev_configuration.md) into the credex-ecosystem.

You'll need to `avatar up` again after you load in order to refresh the context with the READMEs imported from the submodules.

### Developer Intent #2: Message From Developer
The second place to express your intent is in the Message From Developer. The avatar will engage with the first instruction, and you can continue a back and forth with the LLM here through the avatar. There are two ways you can communicate through the avatar. After `avatar up`, then:
  1. Enter simple queries or instructions in the terminal, and/or
  2. Enter more complex queries or instructions at the bottom of the [conversation_thread](avatar/conversation_thread.txt) file, under Message From Developer.

Press enter in the terminal. Whatever is in the terminal will be appended to whatever is in the conversation thread and sent to the LLM. Take a look through [conversation_thread](avatar/conversation_thread.txt) to see the full conversation that you are in with the avatar, including file contents back and forth. A sanitized version is printed to the terminal with the file contents removed for better human readibility.

### Stepping Towards Your Goal
When you launch `avatar up`, the current context of the repo and project is assembled. You can change these and refresh any time with the same command. You then add your overall intention for this specific exchange with the avatar and LLM into the Developer Instructions as above, and then work together to deliver code.

The LLM will get confused if the conversation_thread gets too long, if there are repetitive tweaks on the same bug going back and forth, or if multiple topics or priorities enter the thread.

Steps towards your goal are measured by the cadence of this one-mission-at-a-time model, linked to and driving progress at a strategic level through the intentions and directions set in [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md). To succeed:
1. Drive towards a single and mostly known end state.
2. Achieve that end state and update the Current Project state accordingly.
3. Let the avatar help you create, update, and enhance the Current Project, but the intention expressed there has to be yours. Your intention has to be linked to a larger purpose or campaign, or you will iterate rapidly but not get far.

The difference between the [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) and Message From Developer is that the project will remain largly the same with small changes every time you `avatar up`, and the content of the messages back and for will leave the active memory of the avatar. Those messages are saved in conversation_thread in your commit, to be overwritten with your next commit but preserved in the repository history of greatsun-dev.

To get started, use a Developer Instruction like:
```
review avatar/context/current_project.md and append a full workplan
```
Review the results, stage, commit, and `avatar up` to reload the context including the updated Current Project file.

Now use the workplan in [Current Project](avatar/context/current_project.md) to move forward towards your intent. The avatar can easily reference it and step through it with commands like:
```
execute step 2 in the current project and mark it complete
```

When the avatar pauses to await your response or next instructions, you can continue the conversation with another Developer Instruction in the terminal and/or at the bottom of the [conversation_thread](/workspaces/greatsun-dev/avatar/conversation_thread.txt).

## Branches and Commits
The avatar unifies and links your commits across all repositories, including this one. If you launch the avatar from the dev branch, a new branch will be created for you. If you launch from another branch, that branch will be maintained into the avatar. On launch, branches of the same name as your branch in greatsun-dev will be created (if necessary) and checked out in all the submodule repos.

  - `avatar commit`: Commits and pushes current code to all affected repos with a unified branch name and commit message.

Don't hesitate to commit regularly. Multiple untested commits that move you towards your objective are expected, with testing more likely to be done on a series of commits than on each one. Staging changes can also be very helpful. You want to be able to lock in every step, and if too many changes build up you can lose it all when a wobble develops in the LLM's capacity. Don't save your progress in the short term memory of the avatar, save it in a trail of granular commits. You want to be able to refresh the context any time without significant loss of progress.


git reset --soft HEAD~1



## Running services
Greatsun-dev, credex-core, and all imported clients are brought online in dev mode with:
  - `avatar engage`: fires up the servers across the container and submodules.

## Intent Achieved
Once you have acheived your intent and tested your code to satsifaction for a feature or a fix:
  - `avatar submit`: Creates a pull request for the current branch into the dev branch across all repositories.

Merges into dev will be tested in greatsun-dev for quality assurance, but the merges themselves will be approved in each individual repository. The branches and any codespaces still on it will be deleted after the merge is approved, so do not continue to work on a branch after the merge has been submitted

Continue your work with a new branch off dev.
  - `avatar down` exits back to the terminal.

**On codespaces:** close the window and create a new codespace on dev.
**On local:** switch branches on greatsun-dev with `git checkout dev` and pull the latest with `git pull origin dev` then relaunch with `avatar up`.

## All Commands
Everything listed above in one place for reference:
  - `avatar up`: generates new context for the avatar, and creates and checks out a new branch if you are on dev.
  - `avatar load`: pulls from remote dev to an existing or new branch in all the repos in the container, and installs the submodules set in [Configuration](docs/greatsun-dev_configuration.md) into the credex-ecosystem.
  - `avatar engage`: fires up the servers across the container and submodules.
  - `avatar commit`: Commits and pushes current code to all affected repos with a unified commit message.
  - `avatar submit`: Creates a pull request for the current branch into the dev branch across all repositories.
  - `avatar down` exits back to the terminal.
