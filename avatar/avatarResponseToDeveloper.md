Thank you for providing the context and the opportunity to improve the project structure. Based on the analysis of the existing scripts and the creation of a new management system, here's a summary of the changes and recommendations:

1. New Management System:
   - Created a main management script `manage.sh` as a unified interface.
   - Maintained separate scripts for specific functionalities:
     - `git_manager.sh` for Git operations
     - `start-services.sh` for service management
     - `init-environment.sh` for environment initialization

2. Benefits of This Approach:
   - Modularity: Each script focuses on specific tasks.
   - Flexibility: Easy to add or modify functionalities.
   - Maintainability: Smaller, focused scripts are easier to maintain and debug.
   - Scalability: Can easily integrate new scripts into the main management script.

3. Usage of the New System:
   - Initialize the environment: `./manage.sh init`
   - Perform Git operations: `./manage.sh git <git-command> [repo-name]`
   - Manage services: `./manage.sh service <start|stop|restart|status> [service-name]`
   - Display help: `./manage.sh --help`

4. Recommendations:
   - Review and customize each script for your specific project needs.
   - Update `common.sh` with shared functions and configurations.
   - Add more repositories and services to the respective scripts as needed.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging in each script.
   - Enhance `init-environment.sh` with features like repository cloning or project-specific setups.
   - Keep these scripts in the root directory of your greatsun-dev project.
   - Ensure all scripts have executable permissions: `chmod +x *.sh`
   - Update your project's README.md with instructions for using the new management system.

5. Conclusion on Combining Scripts:
   Combining the scripts is not advisable. The new management system provides a good balance between maintaining separate concerns and offering a unified interface.

Next Steps:
1. Review the created scripts and make any necessary adjustments.
2. Test the new management system thoroughly.
3. Update the project documentation to reflect these changes.
4. Consider implementing additional features or improvements based on your project's specific needs.

Would you like me to make any specific changes or additions to the scripts we've created?
